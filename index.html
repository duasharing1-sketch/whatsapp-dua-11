This powerful dua calls upon Al-Wadūd (The Most Loving) to grant us a special, intimate bond with the beloved of Allah — Rasulullah ﷺ. A love so deep that our names remain present within his noble heart, and his blessed gaze always rests upon us.

Because to be granted the gift of loving loving him ﷺ and to be loved by him ﷺ is one of the greatest honors. 

As stated in an authentic hadith, Rasulullah ﷺ said:

“A person will be with those whom he loves.” — (Bukhari)

*Ya Allah (O Allah), Ya Wadud (O Most Loving), grant us an immense and special love from Your most beloved, Habeebullah, Khayr-ul-Khalqillah, Khatam-ul-Anbiya, Sayyidina Muhammad Rasoolullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam. A love so profound that each of our names is permanently present within his pure and perfected heart, and that his Nazar (his loving gaze) remains upon us at all times.*

This dua is part of *The Supplication of Infinite Blessings* — a powerful collection of heartfelt supplications designed to benefit you in both this life and the next. 

*At Dua Sharing, our mission is simple*: 

To encourage sincere dua, meaningful sharing, and to multiply blessings through a growing global chain of people making dua for one another every single day.

As Rasulullah ﷺ said: 

“The supplication of a Muslim for his brother in his absence will certainly be answered. Every time he makes a supplication for good for his brother, the angel appointed for this task says: ‘Ameen! And may it be for you too.”

Every post we share is taken directly from the full Supplication of Infinite Blessings — with the aim of moving hearts, inspiring action, and reminding us all of what truly matters.

When you share this post, you’re not simply sharing a dua. You’re opening the door to millions of people making sincere dua for you — with the Malaika (Angels) themselves saying “Ameen” to every single one.

May Allah accept it from you, and reward you for all those it reaches through you.

Ameen`;
